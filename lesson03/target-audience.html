            <h3>Personas</h3>
            <p>The Rexburg area is known for being family oriented. There are a lot of families and children. There are a lot of locals and because of the university there is also diversity in the culture and demographics. The weather is cold and snowy in the winter offering a variety of outdoor activities and when the weather warms up there is still plenty to do! The two personas this website will appeal to are family oriented individuals and individuals who enjoy participating in the community.The first persona, those who are family oriented. People who are family oriented want to know about the community they will live in and/or raise their children in. They want to know about the schools and activities for children to join. The second persona, those who are enjoy indoor and outdoor activities. People who enjoy participating in indoor and outdoor communities like to get to know the area and what the area has to offer.

        <section id="scenarios">
            <h3>Scenarios</h3>
            <p>Five scenarios, as I touched on a bit in the above target audience and personas paragraphs, are people who are new to the area, families with children, young adults looking to interact with peers, outdoor activitists, and people looking to be more active in the area. The local businesses support the residents of the area providing the needed goods and services to help families and individuals thrive, grow, and give them the opportunity to be contributing members to the local economy. These scenarios represent people who are new to the area who are getting to know what it has to offer. People who are getting to know what the community has to offer through the goods and services provided to locals.</p>
